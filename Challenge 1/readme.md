# Challenge 1: Creation of the Project in Azure AI Studio

To first start working in our use case, your team must create an:

* **Azure AI hub resource**: The Azure AI hub resource is the top-level Azure resource for AI Studio and provides the working environment for a team to build and manage AI applications. The Azure AI hub resource can be used to access multiple Azure AI services with a single setup such as the Azure OpenAI, Azure Machine Learning, Azure AI Speech.
* **Azure AI Project**: An Azure AI hub resource provides the hosting environment for Azure AI projects in AI Studio. A project is an organizational container that has tools for AI customization and orchestration, lets you organize your work, save state across different tools like prompt flow, and collaborate with others. For example, you can share uploaded files and connections to data sources.
