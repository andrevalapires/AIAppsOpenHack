### Tip
Some components on the Success Criteria might have already been created. Its up to you to identify and understand the components well enough to understand what is still missing.
You don’t need to speak the language of the data source to be able to communicate with it. There are some models that handle better more languages than others. If it is not working, try deploying another model or version.
You might need to just test one of the Datasources.
